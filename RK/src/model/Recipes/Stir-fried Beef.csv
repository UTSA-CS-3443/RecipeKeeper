Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. 
In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. 
Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. 
Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce. 
Add pasta to sauce. 
Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. 
Serve immediately.
