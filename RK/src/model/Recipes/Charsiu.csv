Mix honey, cooking wine, hoisin sauce, kiwi, dark soy sauce, chile sauce, garlic, oyster sauce, and five-spice powder together in a large resealable plastic bag. 
Add pork belly. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible.
Place bag on a plate and marinate pork belly in the refrigerator, flipping occasionally, for at least 2 days.
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) with a rack in the upper third of the oven. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet.
Place pork belly on the wire rack, reserving marinade.
Bake pork belly in the preheated oven until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), about 1 hour. 
Remove pork belly from the oven; baste with reserved marinade.
Move oven rack to the top position and preheat the oven's broiler.
Broil pork until it is dark and glossy and the edges start to blacken, about 5 minutes. 
Flip and baste on the second side. Continue broiling until second side darkens and starts to blacken, about 5 minutes more. 
Slice with a sharp knife.
